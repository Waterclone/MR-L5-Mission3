<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
# Level 5 - Mission 1

Turners is currently undertaking a major re-design of its motor vehicle insurance systems and processes, including an investigation of ways in which the introduction of new technologies can enhance the buyer experience. Here is some information about motor vehicle insurance at Turners [https://www.turners.co.nz/Cars/finance-insurance/car-insurance/].  You have just been assigned to work on this project to help create a new insurance buying experience.

## Your Tasks

### Task 1. Identify Stakeholders

Identify a list of stakeholders who may have an interest to the Motor Vehicle Insurance Buying Experience Re-design project.  

### Task ​​​​​​​​​​​​​​2. Understand Context of a Project

Identify 5 things you consider most important to know either before or at the start of a project in order for you to work effectively
​​​​​​​
### Task 3. Familiarise with tool for Task Management

If you do not already have an account, register (for free) on https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/free
Create 3 columns on your Jira board titled "To-do", "Doing" and "Done". 
Create cards for each of the tasks in this Mission, and tick them off as you go
If you would like to get fancy, invite another candidate to your Jira board and assign Cards to him/her or get him/her to assign Cards to you (Free for up to 10 users)

### Task 4. Learn about Test-Driven Development 

Let's start by understanding the principles of test-driven development.

### Task 5. Create test cases

For your chosen API, write test cases to cover all the scenarios.  Remember to write test cases for boundaries and negative cases.  The end result will be a table that looks like the following API 1 example but with more test cases:

Test Case Number - Input (model, year) - Expected Output ($ value) - Test Description

1	- "Civic", 2020 - 6600 - Sunny day scenario

2	- "911", 2020 -	2020 - Numbers only is ok

3	- "Task-Force", -987 - error message - Negative year

4	- "C200", "twenty twenty" - error message - Wrong data type

### Task 6. Create unit tests
Choose at least 5 of the test cases you designed, implement them as a set of automated unit test using one of the unit testing frameworks.

### Task 7. Create API

Now that you created the unit tests, build your chosen API.  Test your API against your unit tests as you go, until you pass all the tests.

### Task 8. Code Review

Obtain feedback on your code from your team member by allowing them to review your code. Make any necessary changes to the code after the feedback. Similarly, review their code by pointing out the code smells and offering a solution.

### Task 9. Present at Show and Tell

At the Show and Tell next week, your team will jointly present the tasks it has completed.  This presentation should be designed to take around 5 minutes for each team member – so, if you are in a 4-people team you have up 20 minutes in total.  The time limit will be strictly enforced.  You can use PowerPoint slides, Sway or Prezi to help with your presentation. You are encouraged to demonstrate the live API and tests.

### Task 10. Submit your work

By the end of Thursday, upload all of your work (screenshots, presentation slides, documents or other files) using the mission submission form.
